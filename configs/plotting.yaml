# Plotting configuration for DarkBottomLine framework
# This file allows you to customize which plots are generated for different regions and categories

# Variables that should NOT use log scale (multiplicity plots, etc.)
no_log_scale_vars:
  - n_jets
  - n_bjets
  - n_muons
  - n_electrons
  - n_taus
  - n_leptons
  - n_pv
  - pu_npv

# Region-specific variable exclusions
# Format:
#   "region_pattern": [list of variable names to exclude]
#
# Matching rules:
#   1. Exact region match: "1b:SR" matches only the exact region "1b:SR"
#   2. Pattern match: "Top" matches any region containing "Top" (e.g., "2b:CR_Top_mu")
#   3. Category pattern: "1b:" matches all regions in 1b category
#
# Default exclusions (already applied):
#   - z_mass and z_pt are excluded from Top and W CRs
#   - Lepton variables are excluded from SRs
#   - Jet3 variables are excluded from 1b SR and 1b CRs

region_exclusions:
  # Exclude z_mass and z_pt from Top CRs (default - can be overridden)
  SR:
    - z_mass
    - z_pt

  Top:
    - z_mass
    - z_pt

  # Exclude z_mass and z_pt from W CRs (default - can be overridden)
  Wlnu:
    - z_mass
    - z_pt
  Wenu:
    - z_mass
    - z_pt
  Wmunu:
    - z_mass
    - z_pt

  # Example: Exclude additional variables from specific regions
  # Uncomment and modify as needed:
  # "1b:SR":
  #   - jet3_pt
  #   - jet3_eta
  #   - m_jet1jet3

  # "2b:SR":
  #   - lep1_pt
  #   - lep2_pt

  # Example: Exclude variables from all regions in a category
  # "1b:":
  #   - some_variable

  # Example: Exclude variables from all Z CRs
  # Zll:
  #   - w_mass
  #   - w_pt
